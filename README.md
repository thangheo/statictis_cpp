This is a short collection of example on how to use boost library to calculate characteristics of a random sample.
The original source I take from this page : http://www.matrixscience.com/msparser/help/group___shapiro_wilk_source_code.html
To install boost on linux you can simply use this command : 
$sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
on Windows do your own research.
To build the example on Linux :
1. cd into each directory
2. mkdir -p build
3. cmake ..
4. make

The eigen example needs eigen library too.
